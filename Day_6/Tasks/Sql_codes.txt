The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:

 The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters
 The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character


# The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations!

# combine any number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

 _ ==> number of characters

a_ ==> first pos  / _a ==> second pos
